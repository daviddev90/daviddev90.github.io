## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

```javascript
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```javascript
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists**



## Solve 

### Attempt 1

#### Answer

``` javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const max = nums.length

    for (let i = 0; i < max; i++){
        const num1 = nums[i];
        for (let j = i + 1; j < max; j++){
            const num2 = nums[j]
            if (num1 + num2 === target){
                return [i, j]
            }
        }
    }
};
```

I am a six-year front-end developer who has never studied data structures, algorithms, etc. While studying machine learning, I need this knowledge and study for the first time.

It's my first time solving leetcode, so I just tried number one.
When I saw the problem, I felt, "Oh, that's easy."

#### Result

![0001-first-result](/images/typora/0001-first-result.png)

Ok. that's not good.
My code was too slow and needed improvement.



#### Editorial Study

When I checked the editorial, I informed the expected answer and the problem.
They say my approach is Brute Force Approach.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

**Algorithm**

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xx*x* and find if there is another value that equals to $target−x$

**Implementation**

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[j] == target - nums[i]:
                    return [i, j]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$.
  The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.
